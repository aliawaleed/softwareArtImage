# The Musical Mosaic

## Description
For this project, I wanted to work with something new that I haven't previously worked with when using OpenFrameworks. I decided that I wanted to use the webcam and have the user interact with the screen and so I was inspired by the installations in front of the IM lab. On the home page, the user is shown the title and an interactive black and white visual with two buttons, one for a pastel/piano calm theme, and one for a vivid/drum noisy theme. Below is an image of the main screen.

Depending on the button that they click, they will be redirected to one of the following themes, where the colors and audio notes vary with movement and darkness in front of the screen. Below are screenshots for both.
