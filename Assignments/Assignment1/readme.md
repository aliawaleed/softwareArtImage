__Lines and Points__


For this assignment, I made drawing with lines and points that can be controlled by sliders. This drawing is meant to always be symmetrical with the points perfectly spaced and the lines increasing with the number of points, always starting at the center and growing out to the edges of the screen, akways passing through the points on the screen and connecting them together. A slider is also displayed for the user to interact with the drawing and control several aspects that they can see on the screen.
